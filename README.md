# Intro to Sass

## Project setup

Make sure you have installed Node, npm and [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass).

## Run this project

To compile Sass to Css run:

```
    sass sass:styles --watch
```

This command specifies an entry folder (`sass`) and an output folder (`styles`).
The output folder is not tracked in version control.
The files that are outputed are the ones that you need to include in your HTML - browsers only understand CSS.
